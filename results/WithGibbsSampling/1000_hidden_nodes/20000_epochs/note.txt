Learning rate = 0.01
epsilon = 0.001
increase learning rate by: (1 + epsilon)* learning_rate
decrease learning rate by: (1 - epsilon)* learning_rate

Observation of 3 test cases:
- No change: the error drop significally after 5-7 epochs, then stable
- Increase learning rate: stable
- Decrease learning rate: stable
